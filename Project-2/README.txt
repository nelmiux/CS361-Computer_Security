There are 6 java files: In ReferenceMonitor.java, I implemented runExecute, and destroyExecute. The most important methods are readExecute, writeExecute, runExecute, createNewObject, and destroyExecute. The main function is in CovertChannel.java in which I am creating the .out file, reading bytes, passing the instructions, writing to log and .out files, etc... To complie the program, you need to use "javac CovertChannel.java".

Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka: The story begins with a traveling salesman, Gregor Samsa, waking to find himself transformed (metamorphosed) into a large, monstrous insect-like creature. The cause of Gregor's transformation is never revealed, and Kafka himself never gave an explanation. The rest of Kafka's novella deals with Gregor's attempts to adjust to his new condition as he deals with being burdensome to his parents and sister, who are repulsed by the horrible, verminous creature Gregor has become.
